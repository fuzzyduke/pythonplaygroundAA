Design a blockchain token research framework for investors to eval-
uate token value. Some ideas re to include key on-chain metrics,
developer activity , market sentiment, fundamental valuation, and
macro trends. Provide a structured approach to assess liquidity ,
adoption, and risk.
A seven-category framework for token evaluation was developed, allowing investors to assess blockchain
tokens through adjustable metrics covering technical, economic, and adoption factors.
Abstract
This report analyzes 10 studies on blockchain token valuation to develop an investment evaluation framework.
The analyzed research includes theoretical models, market analyses, and previous literature reviews across
major blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
The included studies found that on-chain metrics, particularly gas prices and transaction volumes, correlate
with token values. User adoption rates showed significant influence on token performance, though measure-
ment methods varied across studies. Both traditional financial metrics and blockchain-specific indicators
appeared important for comprehensive token evaluation.
Based on these findings, we propose a seven-category framework for token evaluation: (1) on-chain metrics,
(2) network effects, (3) liquidity measures, (4) market sentiment indicators, (5) technical risk factors, (6)
economic risk assessment, and (7) adoption metrics. Each category includes specific measurement tools and
suggested weightings for different investment scenarios.
The analyzed research showed agreement on the importance of user adoption metrics and on-chain data.
However, studies differed in their assessment of token incentive structures and the reliability of market
sentiment indicators. While quantitative metrics formed the foundation of most analyses, qualitative factors
like protocol governance and ease of use were also identified as relevant considerations.
F or practical application, the framework allows investors to adjust metric weightings based on token type,
blockchain platform, and project maturity . This adaptability helps address the diverse nature of blockchain
token investments while maintaining a structured evaluation approach.

Thematic Analysis
F undamental V alue Drivers
On-chain Metrics Analysis On-chain metrics emerge as crucial indicators for token valuation across
multiple studies:
• Eick (2024) identifies gas price per block, transaction fees, and rewards to miners as significant factors
affecting Ethereum's intrinsic value.
• T o (2023) emphasizes the importance of on-chain cashflow characteristics, particularly revenues re-
tained by protocols, in determining token value.
• Chen et al. (2020) link platform productivity (which can be inferred from transaction data) to token
price stability and user adoption.
• Cong et al.'s (2020) model bases token valuation on aggregated user transactional demand.
However, the studies differ in their assessment of token incentives:
• While some models incorporate them as key factors, T o (2023) finds that token incentives as a cost of
revenue measure have little pricing power.
• This discrepancy suggests that the role of token incentives in valuation may be context-dependent or
require further investigation.

Network Effects and Adoption Metrics Network effects and user adoption emerge as critical factors
in token valuation across multiple studies:
• Cong et al. (2020) emphasize the importance of user network externality and platform adoption in
their dynamic asset-pricing model.
• Chen et al. (2020) link high userbase adoption to stable token prices.
• Li (2022) develops a decision-making framework that integrates participants' roles as users, investors,
and laborers, highlighting the complex interplay between different stakeholders in determining token
value.
• Sareen (2023) provides empirical support for the importance of adoption metrics, finding that Monthly
Active Users significantly affect token volatility in the context of gaming tokens.
These studies consistently highlight the importance of user adoption and network growth metrics in their
token valuation approaches. However, they also indicate that the relationship between adoption and value
is not always straightforward, often following an S-curve pattern as described by Cong et al. (2020).
T echnical Market Indicators
Liquidity Metrics Liquidity emerges as a factor in token valuation, although it is not uniformly addressed
across all studies:
• Sareen (2023) explicitly includes liquidity as one of the main dependent variables in their analysis of
gaming tokens.
• The study finds that the number of faucets for a game and the percentage of tokens dedicated to
rewards and private sale significantly influence liquidity .
• While other studies do not directly measure liquidity , several touch on related concepts:
– Cong et al. (2020) discuss how introducing tokens can lower users' transaction costs on a platform,
which could be seen as a proxy for improved liquidity .
– T o (2023) focuses on on-chain cashflow characteristics, which are closely related to a token's
liquidity profile.
The varying approaches to liquidity across studies suggest that while it is recognized as important, there is
no standardized method for its incorporation into token valuation frameworks.
T rading V olume Analysis T rading volume, while not explicitly analyzed in all studies, is implicitly
considered in several:
• Chen et al. (2020) discuss the volatility of cryptoassets, which is closely related to trading volume.
• Nadler and Guo (2020) examine both on-chain and off-chain trading activity , suggesting that trading
volume in both contexts is relevant to token valuation.
• T o (2023) focuses on on-chain cashflow characteristics, which would likely include measures related to
trading volume.
• However, T o's finding that token incentives as a cost of revenue measure have little pricing power
suggests that the relationship between trading activity (often stimulated by such incentives) and token
value may be complex.
Market Sentiment Indicators Market sentiment emerges as a significant factor in several studies, albeit
with varying degrees of importance:
6

--- Page 7 ---
• Stanley (2019) explicitly includes market sentiment as one of the key variables potentially impacting
investment decisions in ICOs.
• Interestingly , this study finds that ”ease of understanding” is significantly correlated with ROI, sug-
gesting that investor perception plays a crucial role in token valuation, particularly in the early stages
of a project.
• Marin et al. (2023), in their systematic review, identify market sentiment as one of the key factors
affecting token valuation.
• They note the impact of news and events on token prices, highlighting the volatile nature of sentiment
in the cryptocurrency market.
• However, not all studies give equal weight to market sentiment:
– Eick (2024) finds that features of the Ethereum Blockchain Network and valuation metrics have
more predictive power than market sentiment in determining ether's intrinsic value.
The varying emphasis on market sentiment across studies indicates that its importance may depend on
factors such as the maturity of the token, the type of blockchain platform, and the specific use case.
Risk Assessment F ramework
T echnical Risks T echnical risks emerge as a crucial component in several studies' approaches to token
valuation:
• Nadler and Guo (2020) explicitly investigate blockchain-specific risk factors alongside traditional market
risks.
• Their finding of a shift in risk factors from Bitcoin to Ethereum highlights the evolving nature of
technical risks in the blockchain space.
• Li (2022) addresses technical risks through their decision-making framework, which uses Monte-Carlo
methods to address parameter and system uncertainties.
• This sophisticated approach suggests that technical risks in token valuation are complex and may
require advanced modeling techniques to accurately assess.
• Eick (2024) indirectly addresses technical risks by focusing on Ethereum-specific metrics like gas price
and transaction fees.
• These factors, while fundamental to the network's operation, also represent potential sources of tech-
nical risk that could affect token value.
Economic Risks Economic risks are addressed in various ways across the studies:
• Chen et al. (2020) focus on the volatility of platform productivity and its effects on token price stability ,
highlighting the economic risks associated with platform performance.
• Cong et al. (2020) incorporate economic risks in their dynamic asset-pricing model through the concept
of user transactional demand.
• Marin et al. (2023), in their systematic review, identify several economic risk factors affecting token
valuation, including market conditions and macroeconomic factors.
• T o (2023) approaches economic risks through the lens of on-chain cashflow characteristics. By focusing
on revenues retained by protocols, this study provides insights into how economic performance at the
protocol level can affect token value.
Adoption Risks Adoption risks feature prominently in several studies, reflecting the critical role of user
adoption in token value:
7

--- Page 8 ---
• Cong et al. (2020) model platform adoption as following an S-curve, highlighting the potential volatility
in the middle phase of adoption.
• Chen et al. (2020) link adoption to platform productivity and token price stability , indicating that
adoption risks are closely tied to overall platform performance.
• Sareen (2023) provides empirical evidence for the importance of adoption metrics in the context of
gaming tokens, finding that Monthly Active Users significantly affect token volatility .
• Li (2022) addresses adoption risks through their decision-making framework that integrates different
roles of participants (users, investors, laborers).
• This approach suggests that adoption risks are multifaceted and involve complex interactions between
different stakeholder groups.

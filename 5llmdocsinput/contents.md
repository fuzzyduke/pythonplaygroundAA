the purpose is to have domain documents pushed to ai and then have people chat with the ai to understand context.

First we downloaded an llm
then we installed libraries langchain and gpt4all to communicate with the llm
then we created a workflow with 2 py files, 1 to import a document into faiss vector storage, and 2 to query the faiss with the llm for a meaningful response
